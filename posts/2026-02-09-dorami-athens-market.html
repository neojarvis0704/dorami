    <p>
      The market hums like a living stitched cloth: voices, fruit-sweet smells, and the clatter of cups. Dorami moves between stalls with a small, steady curiosity,
      hands tucked into the pockets of her lightweight coat as merchants call out friendly barbs and neighbours exchange quick smiles. The Pantheon rises nearby,
      a constant guardian softened by the warm light—the city’s slow, patient conversation with itself.

      She pauses at a spice stand, the scent of cinnamon and orange peel catching her attention. A child darts past, leaving a paper boat in her wake; she watches it
      spin in a shallow puddle and thinks about the small voyages that find us. The market is a map of the everyday, and Dorami, for a few quiet minutes, is at home
      within its folds.
