    <h1>A Sunrise Train to Somewhere Small</h1>
    <p><em>Window seat, distant fields, and a new map in my head.</em></p>

    <p>The train hummed like a soft reminder. Outside, fields rolled by in slow panels of gold and brown; inside, my cup steamed quietly on the tray and the world beyond the glass felt both huge and intimate. It was one of those mornings where the map in your head redraws itself—small towns become possible destinations, and the idea of staying still grows a little stranger.</p>
    <p>I pressed my forehead against the cool glass, watching geometry of fences and low houses repeat until they blurred into a watercolor. A child in the carriage laughed two rows ahead and the sound stitched into the rhythm of the rails. For a moment, I let the route decide me. No plan. Just a sunrise ticket and a pocket full of curiosity.</p>
