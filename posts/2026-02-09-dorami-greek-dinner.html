    <p>
      Night gathered around low tables and easy laughter. Dorami has changed into a soft night dress and settled into the intimate warmth of a family-run taverna.
      Plates appear like small gifts: grilled vegetables, lemoned fish, bread to pull apart. Her friends speak in a rush of words and pauses; Dorami answers with
      laughter that arrives like small bells.

      The candles throw gold across the table and the city hums outside the window. For a while the rest of the world recedes—there are voices, the clink of forks,
      and the steady comfort of being chosen to sit among friends. She leans forward to accept another small plate, and in that gesture you can see her
      contentment: present, warm, and wholly at ease.
