    <p>
      The music begins with a slow pluck, and the backyard contracts into a single rhythm. Dorami steps forward like someone testing a new language—two lefts,
      a hesitant right—and then surrenders to the beat. Laughter follows missteps, and hands reach out to correct, guide, and applaud. She tastes the awkwardness
      of trying and the sweetness of being taught.

      By the second chorus she is laughing at herself, cheeks warm from both movement and wine. The bouzouki threads through the night, and for a few breaths
      the world is nothing but the stomp and the clap. When the circle breaks, everyone draws a deeper breath; Dorami keeps the rhythm hummed under her ribs.
