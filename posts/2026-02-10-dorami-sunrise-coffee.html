    <p>
      Dawn is a small, careful thing. Dorami meets a barista by the old harbor, where steam and salt meet in a single breath. The coffee is tiny and bitter
      in the best possible way; it teaches patience. They exchange stories between sips—one-liners and longer silences—and the city unfolds its slow day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harbor makes generous promises: gulls, a curve of blue, and a market that will wake to the business of fishermen and bakers. For now, the world
      feels like a fresh page. Dorami writes nothing, but she listens, and that counts for a great deal.
