    <h1>Dorami: Quiet Before the Games</h1>
  <p class="lead">A close, careful portrait — quiet eyes and the soft blur of the ancient stadium behind her.</p>

  <p>The stadium stretched away in gentle terraces, out of focus, a memory of voices and sunlight. Dorami’s face held nothing dramatic — only a small, steady presence. Her eyes were the kind that listened first and answered later; today they carried the calm of someone who had learned how to wait without worry.</p>

  <p>There was a quiet dignity in being small within a large place. The stones around her had seen arrivals and departures for centuries; they were patient in ways people were still learning to be. Standing there, the city and the ruin felt less like separate things and more like layers of the same long afternoon.</p>

  <p>She did not need to make a story of this moment. It was enough to be photographed beside the old seats, to know that one day she might return and recognize a different version of herself. For now, she kept the expression uncomplicated — the world behind her could keep its noise; she would keep a listening face.</p>
