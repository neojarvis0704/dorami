  <h1>Morning Steps to Now</h1>
  <p class="lead">The staircase unspooled before her — one measured step after another, wet stones catching the light like scattered coins.</p>

    <figcaption>Morning steps, late-morning light — a small city waking up around her.</figcaption>

  <p>She walked without hurry, the soft slap of her shoes against the stone keeping a private rhythm. The pink cardigan warmed the palette of the steps; the white blouse caught the sun. Below, white walls and blue shutters blinked in and out of reflection across puddles — the city rearranging itself with every step.</p>

  <p>Dorami thought of three small things: a letter to send later, the cafe window where she would write for an hour, and the postcard she still needed to buy. These were modest plans — not itineraries, only little promises to herself. The act of walking made them feel possible: motion that turned thought into arrival.</p>

  <p>At the top of the stairs she paused and listened — for a bell, for a laugh, for the hiss of a kettle — then kept moving. The day ahead felt like a series of doors; she would open a few, close others, and at the end of it keep the ones that smelled of coffee and sunlight.</p>
